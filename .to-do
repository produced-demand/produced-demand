to-do
features
- saving (user://, packed scenes, resource)
   - interface on title screen to choose between saves, delete saves
- title screen - choose play/tutorial

- add buses to routes after creation
- remove buses/stations/routes/route points (ctrl + click)

- * create new points on route (shift + drag)

- upgrade station capacity
- ➡️ pay to increase max stations/routes

bugs
- double diamond issue - skips station when going through it twice in double pattern
- bus can be pulled away from non-end station by moving route points

-- likely caused by incorrect endpoint behavior --
- bus sometimes runs through end points
- bus occasionaly gets stuck at end point
- moving point caused circle route to always miss station

- pausing causing buses to stop permantly
- placing route points on top of each other stops bus permantly

- wait time runs during pause


MAY HAVE FOUND ERROR - MOVES ACROSS POINTS WHEN CHANGING ROUTE, MAY CAUSE ISSUES WITH LAST-POINT
